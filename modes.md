https://chip-8.github.io/extensions/#chip-10
https://github.com/mattmikolay/viper/blob/master/volume1/issue7.pdf

Increased resolution: 128x64, otherwise identical to CHIP-8. In the original interpreter the memory from 0x055f to 0x0fff is reserved, this limitation doesn't exist in this interpreter.

## CHIP-8E (chip8e)

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattmikolay/viper/master/volume2/issue8_9.pdf

This extension was described by Gilles Detillieux in VIPER volume 2, issue 8/9. In some places the extension by Paul C. Moews from Programs for the COSMAC ELF â€“ Interpreters is called CHIP-8E, however these extensions are different and not compatible.

Identical to CHIP-8, with the following opcodes added:

opcode | description | note

fx1b | skip Vx bytes | 
fx4f | delay timer = Vx; wait until the delay timer reaches 0 | 
fxe3 | wait for strobe at EF4; read Vx from input port 3 | not implemented
fxe7 | read Vx from input port 3 | not implemented

https://github.com/mattmikolay/viper/blob/master/volume1/issue10.pdf

Extension to CHIP-8 by John Bennett, adds the fxf2 instruction to allow the following combinations:
- fxf2 + fy55: store Vx to Vy in memory starting at I; I = I + x + 1
- fxf2 + fy65: load Vx to Vy from memory starting at I; I = I + x + 1

## CHIP-8 with improved BNNN (chip8_fxf2_bnnn)

Extension to CHIP-8 by George Ziniewicz, adds the fxf2 instruction to allow the following combination:
- fxf2 + bnnn: jump to nnn + Vx

## CHIP-8 with FXF2 (chip8_fxf2)

A combination of chip8_fxf2_fx55_fx65 and chip8_fxf2_bnnn:
- fxf2 + fy55: store Vx to Vy in memory starting at I; I = I + x + 1
- fxf2 + fy65: load Vx to Vy from memory starting at I; I = I + x + 1
- fxf2 + bnnn: jump to nnn + Vx

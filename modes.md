# List of modes

This is a list of supported interpeter modes/CHIP-8 extensions. The instruction sets are listed to describe the features of this interpreter, please refer to the original sources for an accurate description. The name in parantheses is understood by the mode option.

## CHIP-10 (chip10)
https://chip-8.github.io/extensions/#chip-10
https://github.com/mattmikolay/viper/blob/master/volume1/issue7.pdf

Increased resolution: 128x64, otherwise identical to CHIP-8. In the original interpreter the memory from 0x055f to 0x0fff is reserved, this limitation doesn't exist in this interpreter.

## CHIP-8E (chip8e)
https://chip-8.github.io/extensions/#chip-8e
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattmikolay/viper/master/volume2/issue8_9.pdf

This extension was described by Gilles Detillieux in VIPER volume 2, issue 8/9. In some places the extension by Paul C. Moews from Programs for the COSMAC ELF â€“ Interpreters is called CHIP-8E, however these extensions are different and not compatible.

Identical to CHIP-8, with the following opcodes added:

opcode | description | note
---|---|---
00ed | stop execution | 
00f2 | no operation | 
0151 | wait until the delay timer reaches 0 | 
0188 | skip the next instruction | 
5xy1 | skip if Vx > Vy | 
5xy2 | store Vx to Vy in memory starting at I; I = I + x + 1 | 
5xy3 | load Vx to Vy from memory starting at I; I = I + x + 1 | 
bbnn | jump to current instruction - nn bytes | 
bfnn | jump to current instruction + nn bytes | 
fx03 | send Vx to output port 3 | not implemented
fx1b | skip Vx bytes | 
fx4f | delay timer = Vx; wait until the delay timer reaches 0 | 
fxe3 | wait for strobe at EF4; read Vx from input port 3 | not implemented
fxe7 | read Vx from input port 3 | not implemented

## CHIP-8 modification for saving and restoring variables (chip8_fxf2_fx55_fx65)
https://chip-8.github.io/extensions/#chip-8-modification-for-saving-and-restoring-variables
https://github.com/mattmikolay/viper/blob/master/volume1/issue10.pdf

Extension to CHIP-8 by John Bennett, adds the fxf2 instruction to allow the following combinations:
- fxf2 + fy55: store Vx to Vy in memory starting at I; I = I + x + 1
- fxf2 + fy65: load Vx to Vy from memory starting at I; I = I + x + 1

## CHIP-8 with improved BNNN (chip8_fxf2_bnnn)
https://chip-8.github.io/extensions/#chip-8-with-improved-bnnn
https://github.com/mattmikolay/viper/blob/master/volume2/issue8_9.pdf

Extension to CHIP-8 by George Ziniewicz, adds the fxf2 instruction to allow the following combination:
- fxf2 + bnnn: jump to nnn + Vx

## CHIP-8 with FXF2 (chip8_fxf2)

A combination of chip8_fxf2_fx55_fx65 and chip8_fxf2_bnnn:
- fxf2 + fy55: store Vx to Vy in memory starting at I; I = I + x + 1
- fxf2 + fy65: load Vx to Vy from memory starting at I; I = I + x + 1
- fxf2 + bnnn: jump to nnn + Vx

## CHIP-48 (chip48)

Same opcodes as CHIP-8, but with quirks.

## SUPER-CHIP 1.0 (schip10)
https://chip-8.github.io/extensions/#super-chip-10

- Increased resolution: 128x64
- Same quirks as CHIP-48
- opcode fx29 has support for large digit sprites
- dxy0 draws a 16x16 sprite in high resolution mode

Added opcodes:

opcode | description | note
---|---|---
00fd | stop execution | 
00fe | disable high resolution mode | 
00ff | enable high resolution mode | 
fx75 | store V0 - Vx in RPL user flags (0 <= x <= 7) |
fx85 | load V0 - Vx from RPL user flags (0 <= x <= 7) |

## SUPER-CHIP 1.1 (schip11)
http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/schip.txt
https://chip-8.github.io/extensions/#super-chip-11

- Mostly identical (added opcodes, quirks) to SUPER-CHIP 1.0
- fx29 doesn't support large digit sprites

Added opcodes:

opcode | description | note
---|---|---
00cn | scroll display n pixels down |
00fb | scroll display 4 pixels right |
00fc | scroll display n pixels left |
fx30 | I = address of large sprite of digit in Vx |

## SUPER-CHIP Compatibility (schpc)
https://chip-8.github.io/extensions/#schip-compatibility-schpc-and-gchip-compatibility-gchpc

- Same as SUPER-CHIP 1.1, but all instructions behave as in CHIP-8

## CHIP-8X (chip8x)
https://chip-8.github.io/extensions/#chip-8x
https://github.com/trapexit/chip-8_documentation/blob/master/Misc/VP580%2C%20VP585%2C%20VP590%2C%20VP595%20Instruction%20Manual%20Including%20CHIP-8X.pdf

This extension adds instructions to control the Color Card, Simple Sound and expansion hex keyboard.

- Programs start at 0x0300
- bnnn is unavailable (replaced with the bxyn instruction)

background colors: blue (default), black, green, red

foreground colors:
value | color
---|---
0 | black
1 | red
2 | blue
3 | violet
4 | green
5 | yellow
6 | aqua
7 | white (default)
